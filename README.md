There is a file in this repository called data.txt.  You can assume that each value in the list is an integer.

1.  Opens the file and reads each number

2.  Stores the numbers in an ArrayList<Integer>

3.  Calculates and prints in an organized way:

    a.  Total number of integers

    b.  The sum of the integers

    c.  The average value

    d.   The maximum and minimum

    e.  The number of even and odd numbers
